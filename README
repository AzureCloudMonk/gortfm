gortfm - Documentation generator for the Go programming language

Currently requires ruby 1.9 in order to use gortfm-util script. Hopefully I
will rewrite it to Go eventually.

Installation:
	cd gortfm
	make install

Simplest usage:
	cd <my-project-dir>
	gortfm $(gortfm-util gofiles)
	cd html
	<my-favourite-browser> <package-name>.html

More complex:
	cd <my-project-dir>
	gortfm-util genrule >> Makefile
	make html
	cd html
	<my-favourite-browser> <package-name>.html

I hope it works for you.. Wasn't tested a lot, but it was able to generate
successfully documentation for the whole Go standard library. Btw, you can do
it yourself:
	gortfm-util stdlib $GOROOT my_go_documentation
	...<wait>
	cd my_go_documentation
	<my-favourite-browser> index.html
	...<enjoy> :-D
